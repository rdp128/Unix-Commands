1) Before deleting files step#2 checks how-many files will be there to remove and archive
find . name "<LogName.*.log>" -mtime +90 -exec ls -ltr {}+

2) Remove individual logs file after archive them in one zip file
find . name "<LogName.*.log>" -mtime +90 -exec tar -czf <archive.tar.bz2> --remove-files {} +

3) Script of above steps: ScriptName: archiveLogs.sh
#!/bin/bash
#Description: Archive logs for X period
#USAGE: .archiveLogs.sh <logDirectory> <logName> <period>

DIR=$1
logName=$2
DAYS=#3
DT=$(date '+%m_%Y')

find ${DIR} "-name ${logName}*" -mtime +${DAYS} -exec tar -czf archive_logs_${DT}.tar.bz2 --remove-files {} +

     BATCH SCRIPT TO move files from one share drive to another and preserve same folder structure as soruce
=======================================================================================================================
Soruce folder structure as per below need to create same folder structure at Destination and  than move
//sourceShareDrivePath/Archive/
 Folder with YYYYMM

batch script
@echo off

set year=%date:~10,4%
set month=%date:~4,2%
if "%month:~0,1"=="0" set month=month:~1 #REM important check --> if month retrive from system date has leading 0 then remove as in bar
REM explanation: in batch number starting with 0 are interpreted as octal values. However 0-7 are valid octal digits 08 and 09 are invalid octal so gives wrong output as batch treted them as decimal

REM validation
echo current date: %year%month

REM get last 12 month (Adjust to whaever number you wanted to go back)
set /a :month-=12"

REM Handle yeat if month goes below 1
if %month lss 1 (
  set /a "month+=12"
  set /a "year-=1"
)

REM add zero to month if required
if %month lss 10 set "month=0%month%"
set newDate="%year%month"

REM validation
echo 12 month ago date: %newDate%

set "sourceDir= <>"
set "destinationDir= <>"

REM Main Logic
REM -->calculated date exits at soruce then only TO DO else exits
REM -->if same date folder doen't exits at destination than create same folder structure before move files

if exist %sourceDir%\%newDate% (
   echo sorce folder [%sourceDir%\%newDate%] is EXISTS
   if exist %destinationDir%\%newDate% ( 
       echo printDestinationDir [%destinationDir%\%newDate%] 
       #REM /E copies all subdir including empty ones | /MOVE: moved files and delete from source | /NP: NO progess percentage display | /NFL: no file listing  
       #REM /XX: Prevets removal of extra files already at destination | /MT: MultiThreading enable 8 parallel thread for faster copying
       robocopy  "%sourceDir%\%newDate%" "%destinationDir%\%newDate%" /MOVE /E /XX /MT:8 /NP /NFL 
       goto :endloop #REM added for AutoSys so job goes to Success else job completed but still shows as failure 
 ) else (
      echo creadting [%%newDate%] directory at %destinationDir%
      mkdir %destinationDir%\%newDate%
      robocopy  "%sourceDir%\%newDate%" "%destinationDir%\%newDate%" /MOVE /E /XX /MT:8 /NP /NFL
      goto :endloop
  )
) else ( 
     echo folder [%sourceDir%\%newDate%] doesn't exists at sorce hence nothing to MOVE
     echo EXITING... 
     exit /b
)

:endloop
