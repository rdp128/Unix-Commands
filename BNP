1) Before deleting files step#2 checks how-many files will be there to remove and archive
find . name "<LogName.*.log>" -mtime +90 -exec ls -ltr {}+

2) Remove individual logs file after archive them in one zip file
find . name "<LogName.*.log>" -mtime +90 -exec tar -czf <archive.tar.bz2> --remove-files {} +

3) Script of above steps: ScriptName: archiveLogs.sh
#!/bin/bash
#Description: Archive logs for X period
#USAGE: .archiveLogs.sh <logDirectory> <logName> <period>

DIR=$1
logName=$2
DAYS=#3
DT=$(date '+%m_%Y')

find ${DIR} "-name ${logName}*" -mtime +${DAYS} -exec tar -czf archive_logs_${DT}.tar.bz2 --remove-files {} +

     BATCH SCRIPT TO move files from one share drive to another and preserve same folder structure as soruce
=======================================================================================================================
Soruce folder structure as per below need to create same folder structure at Destination and  than move
//sourceShareDrivePath/Archive/
 Folder with YYYYMM
  -202401 (Many Sub folder inside this)
    -inf_a
      -From 
        -archive
          -atucal files .csv/xlsx
      -TO
     -inf_B 
  -202402
  ..
  ..
  -202412

batch script
@echo off

set year=%date:~10,4%
set month=%date:~4,2%
if "%month:~0,1"=="0" set month=month:~1 #REM important check --> if month retrive from system date has leading 0 then remove as in bar
REM explanation: in batch number starting with 0 are interpreted as octal values. However 0-7 are valid octal digits 08 and 09 are invalid octal so gives wrong output as batch treted them as decimal

REM validation
echo current date: %year%month

REM get last 12 month (Adjust to whaever number you wanted to go back)
set /a :month-=12"

REM Handle yeat if month goes below 1
if %month lss 1 (
  set /a "month+=12"
  set /a "year-=1"
)

REM add zero to month if required
if %month lss 10 set "month=0%month%"
set newDate="%year%month"

REM validation
echo 12 month ago date: %newDate%

set "sourceDir= <>"
set "destinationDir= <>"

REM Main Logic
REM -->calculated date exits at soruce then only TO DO else exits
REM -->if same date folder doen't exits at destination than create same folder structure before move files

if exist %sourceDir%\%newDate% (
   echo sorce folder [%sourceDir%\%newDate%] is EXISTS
   if exist %destinationDir%\%newDate% ( 
       echo printDestinationDir [%destinationDir%\%newDate%] 
       #REM /E copies all subdir including empty ones | /MOVE: moved files and delete from source | /NP: NO progess percentage display | /NFL: no file listing  
       #REM /XX: Prevets removal of extra files already at destination | /MT: MultiThreading enable 8 parallel thread for faster copying
       robocopy  "%sourceDir%\%newDate%" "%destinationDir%\%newDate%" /MOVE /E /XX /MT:8 /NP /NFL 
       goto :endloop #REM added for AutoSys so job goes to Success else job completed but still shows as failure 
 ) else (
      echo creadting [%%newDate%] directory at %destinationDir%
      mkdir %destinationDir%\%newDate%
      robocopy  "%sourceDir%\%newDate%" "%destinationDir%\%newDate%" /MOVE /E /XX /MT:8 /NP /NFL
      goto :endloop
  )
) else ( 
     echo folder [%sourceDir%\%newDate%] doesn't exists at sorce hence nothing to MOVE
     echo EXITING... 
     exit /b
)

:endloop

FXPB in my terms:

FXPB is credit intermediatory business. We unable or client to trade with other party which is Liquidity provider (Barclays, Deutsche Bank)  and other client of ours 
Example of FXPB in Action from chtGPT:
Let’s say Client A is a hedge fund that wants to trade FX with Deutsche Bank, but they don’t have a direct credit relationship with them. Setting one up would take time, involve legal agreements, and require capital. 
Instead, Client A has an FX Prime Brokerage (FXPB) agreement with us (the Prime Broker). We already have a credit relationship with Deutsche Bank. 
So here’s what happens: 
Client A sends an order to trade EUR/USD with Deutsche Bank via an FX trading platform (like EBS or Reuters). 
Deutsche Bank sees the trade as being done with us (the Prime Broker), not directly with Client A. 
Once the trade is executed, the settlement and risk go through us. 
We then allocate the trade to Client A behind the scenes. 
This way, Client A can trade with Deutsche Bank (or other liquidity providers like Barclays, Citi, etc.) without needing separate agreements with each of them. 
 
To get trades to clear both party has to report their trades with us. 
  - verify trades with credit agreement
